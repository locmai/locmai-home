# Status

- Start date: 2021-02-11
- End date: 2021-08-08
- Final version: [[v0.1.0]]([https://github.com/locmai/humble/releases/tag/v0.1.0])


# Background

In the early of 2021, I started to learn about more about Terraform, GitOps and CI/CD while doing site reliability engineering works at Axon. So thinking about a project that could help me learning by doing make me excited. But no good idea hits me until there is one inspiring project from my co-worker: a homelab project that build a bare metal Kubernetes cluster. So I started the first project of 2021 called the "Humble" project.

# Objectives

The objectives are quite simple to achieve:
- Codify everything from bare metal layer to the underlying infrastructure and the upper Kubernetes with Terraform, Ansible.
- Automate deployment cycle of applications with ArgoCD.

# Overall

Besides the main objectives, I have tried to implement the code with best practices for infrastructure-as-code, figuring out the approaches with different set of tools and frameworks, combining them together for a better DevOps solution. So far, I consider the project is successful with all of my expectations.
